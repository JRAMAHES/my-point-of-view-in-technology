# my-point-of-view-in-technology
Since I have taken this class, I have changed my point of view in technology because now I have learned a few skills that before
made me blind in all of the fields of the technology. Since that I had reason for living, I noticed that the technology will be 
one of the best fields to study in my life. I love the technology since I was a little boy, but unfortunately I could not study 
because it was impossible, it was expensive in my environment of live when I was teenager.  I felt more confident every time that 
I make a visit in the Internet, or every time when I need to find something online I do not struggle with some prompts to get where 
I want to go. I remember at the beginning of this class, I thought this class will not be helpful in my career, but now that I had 
taken this class, I noticed that was very, very important to take it, I was wrong in my thought before. I learned that was a lot of 
benefits in this class to develop my education in the right direction.
